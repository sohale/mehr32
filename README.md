"Mehr32" (1999 –2000): BSc degree project: “Real-time audio processing toolbox in C++ for computer music”.
Keywords: C++, Real-time, Tcl/Tk, DirectSound, Steinberg VST.


Mehr32 is a full digital Audio Engineering studio and toolbox written in C++/C.
It was my final degree project developed back in 1999-2000. The full version will be available soon)
Note that currently only the main file is provided. The library (.h) files will be added later.
Note that this was not written in C++ ISO standards. It is using macros which are now discouraged in current C++ standards.

Todo: Rewrite and refactor using C++ templates.
