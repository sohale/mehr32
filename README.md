"Mehr32" (1999 –2000): BSc degree project: “Real-time audio processing toolbox in C++ for computer music”.
Keywords: C++, Real-time, Tcl/Tk, DirectSound, Steinberg VST.


Mehr32 is a full digital Audio Engineering studio and toolbox written in C++/C.
It was my final degree project developed back in 1999-2000. The full version will be available soon)
Note that currently only the main file is provided. The library (.h) files will be added later.
Note that this was not written in C++ ISO standards. It is using macros which are now discouraged in current C++ standards.

Todo: Rewrite and refactor using C++ templates.

 1.	The “Mehr32” (1999 – 2000) implemented as my BSc degree project titled “Real-time audio processing toolbox in C++ for computer music”. [C++, Real-time, Tcl/Tk, DirectSound, Steinberg VST]. Mehr32 was a C++ library implementing audio processing filters and computer music models of musical instruments for real-time performance on PCs. Example designs included: Real-time reverberator (acoustic environmental effects), string and wind instrument models, and an electric guitar amp. The software could achieve the input/output latency of down to 300ms on a Celeron 366.

 2.	The “FPGA Audio reverberator” (2002): Implemented on Altera CPLD/FPGA. Winner of the First Sharif FPGA Design Contest (FDC); I implemented a working hardware and I implemented (from scratch) both Input and Output modules for the Sony/Phillips Serial Digital audio Interface (SPDIF) protocol. The implemented device applied an IIR filter on the streaming stereo digital audio from a commercial CD player, with less than 3 samples total latency (VHDL/FLEX10K50 CPLD).
