Written in 2000. Sohail Siadat


"Mehr32" (1999 ‚Äì2000): was my BSc degree project:

**‚ÄúReal-time audio processing toolbox in C++ for computer music‚Äù**

Keywords: C++, Real-time, Tcl/Tk, DirectSound, Steinberg VST.


Mehr32 is a full digital Audio Engineering studio and toolbox written in C++/C.
It was my final degree project developed back in 1999-2000. The full version will be available soon)
Note that currently only the main file is provided. The library (.h) files will be added later.
Note  that this was not written in C++ ISO standards. It is using macros which are now discouraged in current C++ standards.

#### IO implemented:
* Steinberg VST
* DirectSound
* normal buffered Win32 sound output `WP32_play()`
* SPDIF (FPGA-version only)
#### Devices:
* Microphone live (as part of above)
* Audio-in live (as part of above)
* Keyobard playing (live)
* Progamatic sequence (melody)

### History
* 1999: (v1) Based on an earlier project previous year 1999 [sohale/jMusic](https://github.com/sohale/jMusic)
* 2000: (v2) Presented as BSc final project at UI (Thesis report available) <span style="color:red">this version</span>
* 2001: (v3) Further extentions: (VST plugin, Live Microphone input, granular synthesis, pitch)
* 2004?: Lost all files due to loss of a hard-disk ü•∫ in pre-github era.
* 2002: FPGA implementation (2002?): SPDIF input and output fully implemented. See [^The-FPGA-version]


### Todo
* Rewrite and refactor using C++ templates.
* Revive by reconstructing from the main.cpp from the BSc Thesis file.



### Related projects:
 1.	The ‚ÄúMehr32‚Äù (1999 ‚Äì 2000) implemented as my BSc degree project titled ‚ÄúReal-time audio processing toolbox in C++ for computer music‚Äù. [C++, Real-time, Tcl/Tk, DirectSound, Steinberg VST]. Mehr32 was a C++ library implementing audio processing filters and computer music models of musical instruments for real-time performance on PCs. Example designs included: Real-time reverberator (acoustic environmental effects), string and wind instrument models, and an electric guitar amp. The software could achieve the input/output latency of down to 300ms on a Celeron 366.

 2.	The ‚ÄúFPGA Audio reverberator‚Äù (2002): Implemented on Altera CPLD/FPGA. Winner of the First Sharif FPGA Design Contest (FDC); I implemented a working hardware and I implemented (from scratch) both Input and Output modules for the Sony/Phillips Serial Digital audio Interface (SPDIF) protocol. The implemented device applied an IIR filter on the streaming stereo digital audio from a commercial CD player, with less than 3 samples total latency (VHDL/FLEX10K50 CPLD).


### The FPGA version
FPGA implementation: SPDIF input and output fully implemented.

Presented and won joint first rank award (2x gold coins üü°üü° prize) (Provided live IO fro audio players but dues too lack oof time, only the Simple FIR & IIR filters were ported to hardware / VHDL ). Here is my [proposal](http://ce.sharif.edu/~fdc/proposals/25.pdf) before winning!

**A Standalone Realtime Digital Audio Reverberator**

> This is a device used in music and audio broadcasting studios for adding virtual acoustic ... interpolation and feedback are implemented with FPGA.
